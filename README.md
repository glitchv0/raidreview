## How Reports Are Generated

**Analysis includes:**
- Per-player, per-boss ability usage (CPM/uptime) comparisons
- Gap analysis vs rank 1 performers for each spec
- Talent and glyph comparison with top performers
- Auto-generated suggestions for improvement
- Tank active mitigation and defensive uptime tracking
- Healer HPS, overheal %, and fistweaving/atonement DPS rotation
