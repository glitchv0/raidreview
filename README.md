## About

Reports are generated by pulling data from the [Warcraft Logs API](https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/) and comparing guild performance against top-tier players.

**Analysis includes:**
- Per-player, per-boss ability usage (CPM/uptime) comparisons
- Gap analysis vs rank 1 performers for each spec
- Talent and glyph comparison with top performers
- Auto-generated suggestions for improvement
- Tank active mitigation and defensive uptime tracking
- Healer HPS, overheal %, and fistweaving/atonement DPS rotation
- Consumable audit (flask, food, potions, engineering)
