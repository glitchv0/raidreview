## IMPORTANT: Healer Ranking Methodology

**Healers are ranked by HPS (healing per second), NOT combined parse.**

The default WCL "combined" parse includes DPS contribution, which can be misleading for healer evaluation. This analysis focuses on actual healing output.

2. **Denounce** during low damage for DPS
3. **Holy Shock** for damage when healing isn't needed
4. Review Lei Shen kill to replicate success

*CPM = Casts Per Minute. Rej=Rejuvenation, WG=Wild Growth, SM=Swiftmend, LB=Lifebloom, RG=Regrowth*

**Analysis:**
- Consistently 20% parse across most fights
- Raw HPS decent but parse suggests underperformance
- Not keeping up with top Resto Druids

**Likely Issues:**
- Wild Growth may not be used on cooldown
- Lifebloom uptime possibly low
- Swiftmend underused
- Limited DPS contribution

**Recommendations:**
1. **Wild Growth on cooldown** (8s CD) - should cast 35+ times in 5-min fight
2. **Lifebloom 100% uptime** on tank
3. **Swiftmend on cooldown** (15s CD) - for Efflorescence
4. **Rejuv blanketing** during low damage
5. Consider weaving Wrath during downtime

#### Talents & Glyphs
| Tier | Choice | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| T1 | Speed of Light | ✅ Mobility |

| T3 | Eternal Flame | ✅ Standard for Holy |

#### Per-Boss Rotation Analysis

*CPM = Casts Per Minute. HS=Holy Shock, HL=Holy Light, WoG=Word of Glory, LoD=Light of Dawn, HR=Holy Radiance, EF=Eternal Flame*

**Comparison to Mightlive (Same Spec):**

| Ability | Holyfrik Avg CPM | Mightlive Avg CPM | Gap |
|---------|------------------|-------------------|-----|
| Holy Shock | 6.0 | 8.8 | **-32%** |
| Holy Radiance | 1.9 | 7.1 | **-73%** |
| Light of Dawn | 0.05 | 4.4 | **-99%** |

**Analysis:**
- Lowest HPS of all healers by a significant margin
- 20k HPS on Iron Qon is critically low
- Parse higher than HPS suggests (38%) due to DPS contribution
- May be DPSing more than healing

**Critical Issue - Iron Qon (20k HPS):**
- Only 12.4M healing over 10+ minute fight
- Other healers did 56-64M healing
- Likely died early or had major issues

**Comparison to Mightlive (Same Spec):**

| Fight | Holyfrik HPS | Mightlive HPS | Gap |
|-------|--------------|---------------|-----|
| Ji-Kun | 47k | 66k | -29% |
| Durumu | 39k | 78k | -50% |
| Primordius | 33k | 78k | -58% |
| Iron Qon | 20k | 90k | **-78%** |
| Twins | 55k | 73k | -25% |
| Lei Shen | 54k | 82k | -34% |

Holyfrik is doing 25-78% less healing than the other Holy Paladin.

**Recommendations:**
1. **Focus on healing first, DPS second**
2. **Holy Shock on cooldown** for Holy Power
3. **Light of Dawn** for AoE healing
4. **Review Iron Qon death** - was there an early death?
5. **Beacon of Light** on tank at all times

## Raid Impact

With five healers in a 25N raid:
- **Total raid HPS:** ~320k average
- **Holyfrik contributes:** ~13% of healing (should be ~20%)
- **Missypriest carries:** ~25% of healing

If Holyfrik improved to match Mightlive:
- +30k raid HPS
- Reduced stress on other healers
- Better cooldown coverage

---

## Priority Actions

| Priority | Player | Issue | Action | Expected Gain |
|----------|--------|-------|--------|---------------|
| 1 | Holyfrik | 20k HPS on Iron Qon | Review death/positioning | +50k HPS |
| 2 | Holyfrik | 42k avg HPS | Focus healing over DPS | +30k HPS |
| 3 | Chubzilla | 20% avg parse | Wild Growth/Swiftmend usage | +20% parse |
| 4 | Mightlive | 25% avg parse | Add DPS contribution | +15% parse |

## Fight-Specific Notes

| Fight | Deaths | Healer Notes |
|-------|--------|--------------|
| Ji-Kun | 1 | Moderate healing - all performed adequately |
| Durumu | **12** | High deaths despite healing - mechanics issue |
| Primordius | 1 | Lower healing needed - clean fight |
| Dark Animus | 1 | Spread healing - challenging |
| Iron Qon | **11** | Long fight, high damage - Holyfrik struggled |
| Twin Empyreans | 1 | Clean fight - all healers performed |
| Lei Shen | **10** | High deaths - healing didn't cause wipes |

---

## Summary

The healing corps has one standout issue: **Holyfrik's output is critically low**, especially on Iron Qon (20k HPS). Addressing this single healer would significantly improve raid survivability.

**Top Performer:** Missypriest (81k HPS average)
**Needs Attention:** Holyfrik (42k HPS average - nearly half of top healer)

Recommendation: Holyfrik should review Holy Paladin healing guides and focus on maximizing healing output before worrying about DPS contribution.
