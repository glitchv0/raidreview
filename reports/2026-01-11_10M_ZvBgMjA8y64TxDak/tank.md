## Detailed Analysis

### Zegadout (Protection Paladin) - 57% Average

**Status:** Good

**Performance by Fight:**

| Fight | Parse | DPS | Notes |
|-------|-------|-----|-------|
| Ji-Kun | 87% | 110k | Excellent |
| Durumu | 62% | 96k | Good |
| Iron Qon | 57% | 72k | Good |
| Lei Shen | 57% | 77k | Good |
| Twin Empyreans | 54% | 87k | Good |
| Primordius | 53% | 101k | Good |
| Dark Animus | 31% | 60k | Below Average |

**Analysis:**
- Solid overall performance
- 87% on Ji-Kun shows capability for high parses
- Dark Animus dip likely due to fight mechanics (tank DPS is lower on this fight due to add management)
- Shield of the Righteous uptime appears adequate

**Recommendations:**
1. Maintain current play
2. On Dark Animus, focus on survival over DPS
3. Could optimize for higher parses on farm content

### Poebearkun (Brewmaster Monk) - 13% Average

**Status:** Needs Work

**Performance by Fight:**

| Fight | Parse | DPS | Notes |
|-------|-------|-----|-------|
| Lei Shen | 32% | 81k | Below Average (best) |
| Twin Empyreans | 18% | 85k | Poor |
| Durumu | 16% | 77k | Poor |
| Iron Qon | 9% | 57k | Very Poor |
| Dark Animus | 9% | 50k | Very Poor |
| Primordius | 8% | 70k | Very Poor |
| Ji-Kun | 3% | 56k | Critical |

**Issues Identified:**

| Issue | Current | Target |
|-------|---------|--------|
| Shuffle Uptime | Likely < 80% | 95%+ |
| Keg Smash Usage | Low | On cooldown |
| Guard Timing | Suboptimal | Proactive |
| Elusive Brew | Underutilized | Stack and use |

**Root Causes:**
1. **Low Shuffle Uptime:** Shuffle should be maintained 95%+ of the fight. This is Brewmaster's primary active mitigation.
2. **Keg Smash Not on Cooldown:** Keg Smash generates Chi and applies debuff. Must be used on CD.
3. **Guard Usage:** Guard should be used proactively before big hits, not reactively.
4. **Stagger Management:** Purifying Brew usage may be suboptimal.

**Recommendations:**

1. **PRIORITY: Shuffle Uptime**
   - Blackout Kick generates Shuffle
   - Aim for 95%+ uptime
   - This is THE most important metric for Brewmaster

2. **Keg Smash on Cooldown**
   - 8 second cooldown
   - Generates 2 Chi
   - Applies Dizzying Haze debuff

3. **Guard Proactively**
   - Use before predictable damage
   - Stack with Elusive Brew when possible

4. **Elusive Brew Management**
   - Build stacks through crits
   - Use at 12-15 stacks for big hits

5. **Purifying Brew**
   - Purify high (red) stagger
   - Don't waste on low stagger

**Expected Improvement:** Following these recommendations should bring parses from 13% to 40%+

## Tank Survivability Impact

Low tank parses don't just mean lower DPS - they indicate suboptimal active mitigation usage:

| Impact | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Healer Stress | Low mitigation = more healing required |
| Tank Deaths | Risk of dying to tank busters |
| Kill Speed | Tanks contribute 10-15% of raid DPS |

**Poebearkun's low Shuffle uptime directly increases healer workload and tank death risk.**
