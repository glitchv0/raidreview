## Executive Summary

| Category | Critical | Needs Work | Good | Excellent |
|----------|----------|------------|------|-----------|
| DPS | 2 | 2 | 1 | 2 |
| Tanks | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 |
| Healers | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 |

**Overall Assessment:** Raid progression is being held back by underperforming DPS and both healers performing well below world average. Multiple wipes on Dark Animus (6 wipes) indicate mechanical issues. Top performers Calrion and Cursedclam are carrying the raid.
