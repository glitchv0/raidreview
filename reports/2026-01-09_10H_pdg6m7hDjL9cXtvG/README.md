### Immediate (This Week)
1. **Council Strategy:** Review heroic mechanics - 13 wipes indicates fundamental strategy issues
2. **DPS Rotations:** Focus on core ability CPM improvements (see dps.md for details)
3. **Tank Mitigation:** Zegadout should prioritize Shield of the Righteous over Word of Glory

### Short-Term (Next 2 Weeks)
1. **Gear Upgrades:** Priestsky needs T15 set bonuses for improved throughput
2. **Consumables:** Ensure all raiders have proper flasks and food
3. **Progress:** Work on Heroic Horridon and Council mechanics

### Long-Term
1. **Recruitment:** Consider adding a third healer for progression content
2. **Alt Gearing:** Develop backup tanks/healers for roster flexibility
