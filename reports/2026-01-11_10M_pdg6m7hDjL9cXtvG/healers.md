## IMPORTANT: Healer Ranking Methodology

**Healers are ranked by HPS (healing per second), NOT combined parse.**

The default WCL "combined" parse includes DPS contribution, which can be misleading for healer evaluation.

## Detailed Analysis

### Kamakmeleon (Restoration Druid) - Good

**Average HPS:** 82k
**Average Parse:** 65%

| Fight | HPS | Parse | Notes |
|-------|-----|-------|-------|
| Megaera | 121k | 88% | Excellent |
| Jin'rokh (10H) | 100k | 64% | Good |
| Tortos | 82k | 48% | Average |
| Council | 78k | 63% | Good |
| Horridon | 48k | 64% | Average (lower damage fight) |

**Analysis:**
- Strong performance, especially on Megaera (121k HPS, 88% parse)
- 100k HPS on Jin'rokh shows capability for high output
- Consistent 60%+ parses on most fights

**Strengths:**
- Wild Growth usage appears good
- Lifebloom uptime likely maintained
- Good cooldown timing

**Minor Recommendations:**
- Review Tortos (48% parse) for optimization
- Ensure Tranquility used during high damage
- Nature's Vigil on cooldown

---

### Priestsky (Discipline Priest) - CRITICAL

**Average HPS:** 61k
**Average Parse:** 18%

| Fight | HPS | Parse | Notes |
|-------|-----|-------|-------|
| Megaera | 82k | 45% | Best performance |
| Jin'rokh (10H) | 61k | 4% | Critical |
| Tortos | 59k | 17% | Poor |
| Council | 52k | 3% | Critical |
| Horridon | 50k | 21% | Poor |

**Analysis:**
- 4% on Jin'rokh and 3% on Council are extremely concerning
- Only Megaera showed reasonable performance (45%)
- HPS consistently lower than co-healer

**Comparison to Kamakmeleon:**

| Fight | Priestsky HPS | Kamakmeleon HPS | Gap |
|-------|---------------|-----------------|-----|
| Jin'rokh (10H) | 61k | 100k | -39% |
| Horridon | 50k | 48k | +4% |
| Council | 52k | 78k | -33% |
| Tortos | 59k | 82k | -28% |
| Megaera | 82k | 121k | -32% |

Priestsky is doing 25-40% less healing than the co-healer on most fights.

**Likely Issues:**

1. **Atonement Healing**
   - Penance may not be used on cooldown
   - Smite filler insufficient
   - Holy Fire on cooldown?

2. **Spirit Shell**
   - Timing appears off or not used
   - Should be used BEFORE major damage

3. **Prayer of Mending**
   - Likely underused
   - Should be cast on cooldown (10s CD)

4. **Power Word: Shield**
   - May not be blanketing efficiently
   - Rapture timing for mana

**Recommendations:**

1. **CRITICAL: Atonement Rotation**
   - Penance on cooldown (enemy target)
   - Smite as filler
   - Holy Fire on cooldown
   - Atonement should be 30-40% of healing

2. **Spirit Shell**
   - Use 15s BEFORE major damage
   - Converts healing into absorbs
   - Critical for: Ionization, Static Burst, etc.

3. **Prayer of Mending**
   - Cast on cooldown
   - 4-5 min fight = 25-30+ casts expected

4. **Archangel Usage**
   - Build 5 Evangelism stacks
   - Pop Archangel for 25% healing buff
   - Should have 8+ uses per fight

5. **Cooldowns**
   - Power Infusion: On cooldown
   - Pain Suppression: Tank cooldown
   - Barrier: Stack for mechanics

**Expected Improvement:** 61k → 90k+ HPS

## Healer Comparison

| Metric | Kamakmeleon | Priestsky |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| Avg HPS | 82k | 61k |
| Avg Parse | 65% | 18% |
| Best Fight | Megaera (88%, 121k) | Megaera (45%, 82k) |
| Worst Fight | Tortos (48%) | Council (3%) |
| Status | Good | Critical |

The gap between healers is significant. Priestsky needs immediate attention to bring healing output to an acceptable level.

---

## Raid Impact

With one healer performing at 18% average:
- Increased pressure on Kamakmeleon
- Higher risk of deaths during damage spikes
- Less margin for error on mechanics

Bringing Priestsky to median (50%+) would:
- Balance healing load
- Reduce death count
- Allow more aggressive play

## Priority Actions

| Priority | Player | Issue | Action | Expected Gain |
|----------|--------|-------|--------|---------------|
| 1 | Priestsky | 3-4% parses | Atonement rotation overhaul | +50% HPS |
| 2 | Priestsky | Spirit Shell timing | Pre-damage usage | +20% HPS |
| 3 | Kamakmeleon | Tortos parse | Review fight strategy | +10% |
