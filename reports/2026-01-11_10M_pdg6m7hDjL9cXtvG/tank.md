### Zegadout (Protection Paladin) - 34% Average

**Status:** Needs Work

| Fight | Parse | DPS | Notes |
|-------|-------|-----|-------|

| Megaera | 51% | - | Average |
| Tortos | 26% | - | Poor |

| Horridon | 10% | 74k | Critical |

**Analysis:**
- Only Council showed good performance (69%)
- 10% on Horridon is very concerning
- Large variance suggests inconsistent play

**Likely Issues:**
- Shield of the Righteous uptime low
- Not using Avenger's Shield on Grand Crusader procs
- Consecration uptime may be low
- May be playing too defensively

**Recommendations:**

1. **Shield of the Righteous**
   - Use at 3 Holy Power
   - Target 60%+ uptime
   - This is your primary AM ability

2. **Grand Crusader Procs**
   - Use Avenger's Shield IMMEDIATELY on proc
   - Free damage and threat

3. **Rotation Priority**
   - Crusader Strike > Judgment > Avenger's Shield > Hammer of Wrath > Consecration

4. **Avenging Wrath**
   - Use twice per fight
   - Stack with other damage cooldowns

**Expected Improvement:** Following these recommendations should bring parses from 34% to 50%+
