## Raid-Wide Issues

### Death Count by Fight

| Fight | Deaths | Impact |
|-------|--------|--------|
| Durumu | **12** | Mechanics - Light Spectrum/Disintegration Beam |
| Iron Qon | **11** | Long fight, tornado positioning |
| Lei Shen | **10** | Intermissions, Thunderstruck stacking |
| Ji-Kun | 1 | Clean |
| Primordius | 1 | Clean |
| Dark Animus | 1 | Clean |
| Twins | 1 | Clean |

**Recommendation:** Focus on survival mechanics before DPS optimization on Durumu, Iron Qon, and Lei Shen.
