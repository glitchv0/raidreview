## IMPORTANT: Healer Ranking Methodology

**Healers are ranked by HPS (healing per second), NOT combined parse.**

The default WCL "combined" parse includes DPS contribution, which can be misleading for healer evaluation. This analysis focuses on actual healing output.

## Healer Summary

| Player | Spec | Avg HPS | Avg Parse | Status |
|--------|------|---------|-----------|--------|
| Priestsky | Disc Priest | 25.6k | 15% | Needs Work |
| Kamakmeleon | Resto Druid | 3.8k | 51% | Average |

## HPS by Fight

## Detailed Analysis

### Priestsky (Discipline Priest) - Needs Work

**Average HPS:** 25.6k | **Average Parse:** 15%

| Fight | HPS | Parse | Notes |
|-------|-----|-------|-------|
| Ji-Kun | **35k** | 25% | Best HPS |
| Durumu | 35k | 23% | Good |
| Twins | 33k | 19% | Average |
| Iron Qon | 25k | 17% | Average |
| Primordius | 22k | 8% | Below Average |
| Lei Shen | 21k | 9% | Below Average |
| Animus | **8k** | 2% | Critical |

**Analysis:**
- Consistent HPS on most fights except Dark Animus (8k - very low)
- Parse consistently low (15% average) suggests underperformance vs. other Disc Priests
- Ji-Kun and Durumu show decent output
- Dark Animus parse of 2% is critical

**Strengths:**
- Reasonable healing output on high-damage fights
- Consistent performance across most encounters

**Areas for Improvement:**
- Dark Animus output critically low - possible death or positioning issue
- Overall parse suggests rotation/cooldown optimization needed
- Consider adding more DPS contribution during low-damage phases

**Recommendations:**
1. **Review Dark Animus fight** - 8k HPS suggests major issue (death, OOM, or mechanics)
2. **Power Word: Shield usage** - ensure consistent blanketing
3. **Penance on cooldown** for healing and DPS
4. **Mindbender/Shadowfiend** for mana and DPS contribution

### Kamakmeleon (Restoration Druid) - Average

**Average HPS:** 3.8k | **Average Parse:** 51%

| Fight | HPS | Parse | Notes |
|-------|-----|-------|-------|
| Primordius | **7.5k** | **80%** | Excellent |
| Iron Qon | 5.3k | 72% | Good |
| Durumu | 4.1k | 57% | Good |
| Animus | 3.6k | 62% | Good |
| Lei Shen | 3.0k | 56% | Average |
| Ji-Kun | 1.9k | 35% | Below Average |
| Twins | **1.3k** | 38% | Below Average |

**Analysis:**
- Very low raw HPS numbers but high parse suggests efficient healing
- In a 2-healer 10N setup, Priestsky is doing most of the heavy lifting
- High parse (51% avg) indicates good relative performance for the healing done
- Primordius (80%) and Iron Qon (72%) standout performances

**Strengths:**
- Excellent parse on Primordius (80%)
- Consistent mid-tier performance
- Contributing DPS during low-damage phases (high combined parse)

**Areas for Improvement:**
- Ji-Kun and Twins HPS very low
- May be DPSing too much on some fights

**Notes:**
- In 10N with only 2 healers, the HPS disparity suggests role division
- Kamakmeleon appears to be playing a DPS/healing hybrid role
- This works if Priestsky can solo-heal most damage, but risky on progression

## Healing Comparison

| Metric | Priestsky | Kamakmeleon |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| Avg HPS | **25.6k** | 3.8k |
| Avg Parse | 15% | **51%** |
| Best Fight | Ji-Kun | Primordius |
| Worst Fight | Animus | Twins |
| Status | Needs Work | Average |

---

## Raid Impact

With two healers in a 10N raid:
- **Total raid HPS:** ~29k average
- **Priestsky contributes:** ~87% of healing
- **Kamakmeleon contributes:** ~13% of healing

This healing split is unusual:
- Priestsky is essentially solo-healing most fights
- Kamakmeleon appears to be in a hybrid DPS/healing role
- Works when overgeared, but risky for progression

## Priority Actions

| Priority | Player | Issue | Action | Expected Gain |
|----------|--------|-------|--------|---------------|
| 1 | Priestsky | 2% parse on Animus | Review death/positioning | +20% parse |
| 2 | Priestsky | 15% avg parse | Rotation/cooldown review | +15% parse |
| 3 | Kamakmeleon | 1.3k HPS on Twins | Increase healing priority | +3k HPS |
| 4 | Kamakmeleon | Low Ji-Kun HPS | Balance DPS/healing | +2k HPS |

## Fight-Specific Notes

| Fight | Deaths | Healer Notes |
|-------|--------|--------------|
| Ji-Kun | 0 | Clean kill, Priestsky solo-healed effectively |
| Durumu | 0 | Clean kill, good healing output |
| Primordius | **4** | Highest death count - healing may have struggled |
| Dark Animus | **8** | High deaths, Priestsky struggled (8k HPS) |
| Iron Qon | 0 | Clean kill despite long fight |
| Twin Empyreans | 0 | Clean kill |
| Lei Shen | **1** | Final boss, one death |

---

## Summary

The healing team has an unusual dynamic where **Priestsky is doing the vast majority of healing** while Kamakmeleon appears to be in a DPS-hybrid role.

**Priestsky:** Carrying healing load but parsing low (15%). The Dark Animus performance (2% parse, 8k HPS) is critical and needs immediate review.

**Kamakmeleon:** Good combined parse (51%) suggests effective play, but very low HPS contribution. This works in farm content but may cause issues on harder fights.

Recommendation: If progressing content, Kamakmeleon should shift more toward healing. For farm content, current setup works but Priestsky's Animus performance needs investigation.
