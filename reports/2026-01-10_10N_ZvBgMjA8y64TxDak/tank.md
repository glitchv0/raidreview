### Poebearkun (Brewmaster Monk) - CRITICAL

**Status:** Critical

| Fight | Parse | Notes |
|-------|-------|-------|
| Lei Shen | 38% | Best performance |
| Twin Empyreans | 18% | Below Average |
| Durumu | 16% | Below Average |
| Iron Qon | 10% | Poor |
| Dark Animus | 8% | Poor |
| Primordius | 8% | Poor |
| Ji-Kun | **3%** | Critical |

**Analysis:**
- Critically low parses across all fights (12% average)
- Even best fight (Lei Shen 38%) is below average
- Ji-Kun at 3% is extremely concerning
- Significant gap compared to Zegadout on every fight

**Comparison to Zegadout:**

| Fight | Poebearkun | Zegadout | Gap |
|-------|------------|----------|-----|
| Ji-Kun | 3% | 86% | **-83%** |
| Durumu | 16% | 62% | -46% |
| Primordius | 8% | 52% | -44% |
| Dark Animus | 8% | 31% | -23% |
| Iron Qon | 10% | 57% | -47% |
| Twin Empyreans | 18% | 54% | -36% |
| Lei Shen | 38% | 56% | -18% |

Poebearkun is consistently 20-80% below Zegadout in parse.

**Likely Issues:**
- Low DPS output (parse is primarily DPS-based for tanks)
- Possible uptime issues on boss
- May be playing too defensively
- Rotation may need significant work

**Recommendations:**

1. **Keg Smash on Cooldown**
   - Primary Chi generator and threat
   - Should be #1 priority ability

2. **Blackout Kick Usage**
   - Maintain Shuffle buff at all times
   - Use excess Chi for DPS

3. **Tiger Palm**
   - Fill GCDs between abilities
   - Maintains Tiger Power buff

4. **Jab Usage**
   - Fill remaining time with Jab for Chi

5. **Guard Timing**
   - Use for big damage, not on cooldown
   - Don't waste on small damage

6. **Review Ji-Kun (3%)**
   - This is critically low - needs video review
   - Check for deaths, positioning issues, or excessive downtime

## Summary

The tank team has a **significant performance disparity**:

**Zegadout (Prot Paladin):** Performing well at 61% average. Ji-Kun (86%) was excellent. Only Dark Animus (31%) needs work.

**Poebearkun (Brewmaster):** Critically underperforming at 12% average. Every fight is below 40%, with Ji-Kun at 3%. This needs immediate attention.

**Key Takeaways:**
1. Poebearkun needs comprehensive Brewmaster review - rotation, uptime, cooldown usage
2. The 5x parse gap between tanks is unusual and concerning
3. Zegadout is carrying the tank role effectively
4. Dark Animus caused issues for both tanks (8 deaths in raid)

Recommendation: Poebearkun should review Brewmaster guides, compare logs to top performers, and potentially get coaching from experienced Brewmaster players. The gap is too large to be just gear difference.
