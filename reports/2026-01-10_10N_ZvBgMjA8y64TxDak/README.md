## Raid-Wide Issues

### Death Count by Fight

| Fight | Deaths | Impact |
|-------|--------|--------|

| Primordius | **4** | Mechanics or healing issue |
| Lei Shen | 1 | Minor |
| Ji-Kun | 0 | Clean |
| Durumu | 0 | Clean |
| Iron Qon | 0 | Clean |
| Twins | 0 | Clean |

## Summary

The raid completed 7/13 bosses with mixed results:
- **Strengths:** Calrion excellent DPS (72%), Zegadout solid tanking (61%), clean kills on 4 bosses

3. Chubbztotem needs Elemental Shaman rotation fundamentals
4. Dark Animus strategy needs review - 8 deaths is too many
5. Healing imbalance works for farm but risky for progression
