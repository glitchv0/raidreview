### Chubzilla (Restoration Druid) - Needs Work

**Average Parse:** 27% | **Status:** Needs Work

**Likely Issues:**

**Recommendations:**
1. **Wild Growth on cooldown** (8s CD) - primary AoE heal
2. **Lifebloom 100% uptime** on tank
3. **Swiftmend on cooldown** (15s CD) - triggers Efflorescence
4. **Rejuv blanketing** during incoming damage
5. Consider weaving Wrath/Moonfire during downtime for DPS contribution

### Mightlive (Holy Paladin) - CRITICAL

**Average Parse:** 8% | **Status:** Critical

| Fight | Parse | Notes |
|-------|-------|-------|
| Council of Elders | 61% | Average (outlier) |
| Jin'rokh | 19% | Poor |
| Horridon | 8% | Critical |
| Tortos | 6% | Critical |
| Megaera | **3%** | Critical |

**Analysis:**
- Critically low performance on 4 of 5 fights
- Council of Elders was the only acceptable performance (61%)
- 3% on Megaera is near-zero contribution
- Significant healing output issues

**Critical Issues:**
- Average of 8% (excluding Council outlier) is severely underperforming
- Holy Paladin should be competing with Resto Shaman for throughput
- May be dying early, having uptime issues, or fundamental rotation problems

**Possible Causes:**
- Early deaths on fights
- Not healing during significant portions of encounters
- Beacon of Light mismanagement
- Holy Shock not used on cooldown
- Eternal Flame/Holy Radiance underutilized

**Recommendations:**
1. **Immediate review** - check death logs for early deaths
2. **Holy Shock on cooldown** - primary Holy Power generator
3. **Beacon of Light on tank** at all times
4. **Eternal Flame** with 3 Holy Power for tank healing
5. **Light of Dawn/Holy Radiance** for AoE healing
6. Review Council kill to understand what was different

## Raid Impact

With five healers in a 25N raid:
- **Poeshammykun** is carrying the healing team
- **Mightlive** contributing almost nothing on most fights
- Significant healing disparity causing stress on other healers

If Mightlive improved to 50%:
- More even healing distribution
- Reduced stress on Poeshammykun
- Better cooldown coverage
- Fewer deaths from healing gaps

---

## Priority Actions

| Priority | Player | Issue | Action | Expected Gain |
|----------|--------|-------|--------|---------------|
| 1 | Mightlive | 3-8% parses on most fights | Review for early deaths, rotation overhaul | +40% parse |
| 2 | Chubzilla | 27% avg parse | Wild Growth/Swiftmend usage, Lifebloom uptime | +20% parse |
| 3 | Chaewonsham | High variance (16-74%) | Review Tortos/Megaera specifically | +15% parse |
| 4 | Missypriest | 18% on Jin'rokh | Review Jin'rokh positioning/rotation | +10% parse |

---

## Fight-Specific Notes

| Fight | Deaths | Healer Notes |
|-------|--------|--------------|
| Jin'rokh | 10 | High deaths - healing under pressure |
| Horridon | 1 | Clean kill - healers adequate |
| Council of Elders | 0 | Flawless - best healer performance |
| Tortos | 1 | Clean kill - some healer variance |
| Megaera | 1 | Clean kill - Mightlive at 3% |

---

## Summary

The healing corps has one standout performer (Poeshammykun at 76%) and one critical issue (Mightlive at 8%). The middle healers are performing adequately but inconsistently.

**Top Performer:** Poeshammykun (76% average)
**Needs Immediate Attention:** Mightlive (8% average - lowest healer by far)

Recommendation: Mightlive should review Holy Paladin healing guides and focus on basic rotation execution. Check for early deaths that may be skewing results.
