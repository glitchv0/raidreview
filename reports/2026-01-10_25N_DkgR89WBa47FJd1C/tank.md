Both tanks are performing at an average level overall (40% each), but with different patterns:

**Key Issues:**
- Jin'rokh was problematic for both tanks (4% and 23%)

- Zegadin's inconsistency suggests execution variance

**Recommendation:** Focus on consistency and active mitigation uptime. Zegadin should review what went right on Council and apply it to other fights. Both tanks should review Jin'rokh specifically.
